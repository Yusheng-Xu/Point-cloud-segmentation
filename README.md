# Voxel- and graph-based point-cloud-segmentation
This is the source code for the algorithm of Voxel- and Graph-based Segmentation (VGS/SVGS).

### Environment:
The code is written in C++ and tested in VS2015.

### Dependence:
The code depends on the following third-party libraries:
-PCL 1.8.1.

### How to use these codes：
please refer to "Use_Test"

The "input_vector" encodes the input parameters (see "Task_File_VGS.txt" and "Task_File_SVGS.txt"), you can change it according to your demands.

Special thanks to [M.Sc. Dong Lin](https://tu-dresden.de/bu/umwelt/geo/ipf/photogrammetrie/die-professur) from TU Dresden for correcting bugs in the codes!

### Reference:

Testing dataset (Town_Test.pcd) is cropped from ETH Zurich dataset： http://semantic3d.net/
